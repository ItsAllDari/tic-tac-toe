<h1>Tic Tac Toe: A Description</h1>

<h3>This application allows the user to play a game of tic tac toe against themselves or a friend, placing an X or O to determine whcih space they will make their move</h3>

<h2>Planning for the Game</h2>
<p>I plan to approach this project step by step and slowing make improvements day by day so that it can make sense and be as efficient as possible. I would like to first start with the sign in, up, and sign out options for the game before moving into setting up the game mechanics for the board and play. The first day will consist of setting up user authentication steps, moving on to setting up the HTML of the page to have the game layout set up, then I would like to work on the Javascript functions to allow the game to play and determine a winner. With time permitting I would love to add some design to the game like colors for the page and different players. If I am able, it would be cool to add a scoreboard of some sort at the end too.</p>
